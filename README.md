# Learning Patterns in Javascript
This repo includes example code for this [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0_C_32YKLpwykmU7t7bLZ7guRw1psa52)

You can find the code for each video in the corresponding folder inside `src`.

It should be noted that this is not a comprehensive list of patterns, but rather a list of patterns that I find useful in my day to day work.

## Patterns
- Container/Presentational Pattern
- Higher Order Component Pattern (HOC) - coming soon
- Render Props Pattern - coming soon
- Compound Pattern - coming soon
